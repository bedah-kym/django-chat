THIS APP IS COMPROMISED OF WEBSOCKETS INSIDE A REGULAR DJANGO PLATFORM HELPED BY A REST API TO
TALK TO THE REST OF THE WORLD.

when you send a text in the chatroom the JavaScript in the browser gets the details like the chatroom ,user,message and 
paases it to the websocket (consumers.py) which parses the data and creates a new message.

The new message is saved then displayed back to the user inthe chatroom, you wouldnt want to send a text an not see it.
now remember when the message was given to the websocket consumer? the function to recieve the data did some checks to
see if the sender is not mathia but is part of the allowed senders. if true it calls the get mathia reply which gets the 
mathia reply and makes a new message from it and saves it.

now since mathia isnt inside the app but on a different platform the apps needs to communicate through API calls.
when you send the message in the chatroom there was a signal which sent a post request (with your sent message inside) to the chatbots API.
the chatbot api recieves it then returns a reply by sending a post request with the answer to the chatapp API.

we hope to make this flow more efficient and secure as well as add functionality to send and recieve audio/visual data.
