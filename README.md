# Mathia-project

<h3>PROJECT OVERVIEW</h3>
    <strong>Project design </strong>
    <img src = " " alt="">
<p>MATHIA AI project's main goal is to produce lifelike consciousness, the project will require a combination of multisensory input ie sound and video, machine learning algorithms, and hormonal design. The AI will need to be trained on different types of data, including input, output, and modified input/output, to produce a realistic sensory output in real-time. Additionally, the AI will need to be designed with an interface that allows for wake, sleep, and stop modes, as well as the ability to connect to other modules and handle massive amounts of data. </p>

<p>Educating MATHIA like a child would require a gestation period over a specified amount of time, during which the AI will be exposed to different types of data, including stories, music, and philosophical concepts. The data will be crystallized and stored permanently to serve as the AI's base memory, which will never be modified by anyone.</p>

<h4> FRAMEWORKS AND LIBRARIES TO BE USED </h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>TensorFlow</strong>: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by Google. It provides a wide range of tools and libraries for building and training machine learning models, including neural networks, and it supports both CPU and GPU acceleration.Tensorflow is a product of choice for building and training hormone like machine learning algos.</li>
  <li><strong>OpenCV</strong>: OpenCV is a popular computer vision library that provides a wide range of tools for image and video processing, including image recognition, object detection, and facial recognition.</li>
  <li><strong>Django Rest Framework</strong> : this is a REST API framework build on django using python, it is a powerfull api which can interface with micro computers like raspberry-pi and arduino.It allows for easy intergration of the Mathia AI with user friendly interface like react for a web app or android for a mobile portable use.</li>
