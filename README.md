<p>MATHIA AI project's main goal is to produce lifelike consciousness, the project will require a combination of multisensory input ie sound and video, machine learning algorithms, and hormonal design. The AI will need to be trained on different types of data, including input, output, and modified input/output, to produce a realistic sensory output in real-time. Additionally, the AI will need to be designed with an interface that allows for wake, sleep, and stop modes, as well as the ability to connect to other modules and handle massive amounts of data. </p>

<p>Educating MATHIA like a child would require a gestation period over a specified amount of time, during which the AI will be exposed to different types of data, including stories, music, and philosophical concepts. The data will be crystallized and stored permanently to serve as the AI's base memory, which will never be modified by anyone.</p>

<h4> FRAMEWORKS AND SERVICES TO BE USED </h4>
<ol>
  <li><strong>TensorFlow</strong>: TensorFlow is an open-source machine learning library developed by Google. It provides a wide range of tools and libraries for building and training machine learning models, including neural networks, and it supports both CPU and GPU acceleration.Tensorflow is a product of choice for building and training hormone like machine learning algos.</li>
  <li><strong>Google Cloud Vision API</strong>: This is a tool that enables developers to understand the content of an image by encapsulating powerful machine learning models in an easy to use REST API, it quickly classifies images into thousands of categories (e.g., "sailboat", "lion", "Eiffel Tower"), detects individual objects and faces within images, and finds and reads printed words contained within images user can build metadata on image catalog, moderate offensive content, or enable emotion recognition through image sentiment analysis.</li>
  <li><strong>IBM WatsonÂ® Natural Language Understanding </strong>(NLU) uses deep learning to extract meaning and metadata from unstructured text data. Get underneath your data using text analytics to extract categories, classification, entities, keywords, sentiment, emotion, relations, and syntax.</li>
  <li><strong>Django Rest Framework</strong> : this is our main REST API framework build on django using python which will talk to all other API's to allow for a centralized access to third party APIs, it is a powerfull api which can interface with micro computers like raspberry-pi and arduino.It allows for easy intergration of the Mathia AI with user friendly interface like react for a web app or android for a mobile portable use.</li>

    <li> <strong> AWS SageMaker </strong> is a cloud service to intergrate with Tensorflow to allow for the massive hardware requirements that comes with training and tuning MATHIA AI. Image Containers with scripts made with Tensorflow can be deployed to AWS sagemaker with a training job for real-time inference</li>

   <li><strong>Amazon Polly </strong> Amazon Polly uses deep learning technologies to synthesize natural-sounding human speech, so you can convert articles to speech. With dozens of lifelike voices across a broad set of languages also to build speech-activated applications.Polly will assist in making Mathia sound life-like and tell stories with
   relevant emotion and tones.</li>

   <li><strong>Amazon Relational Database Service</strong> (Amazon RDS) is a collection of managed services that makes it simple to set up, operate, and scale databases in the cloud.It bosts of support for the following databases, MySQL, MariaDB, PostgreSQL, Oracle, and SQL Server.This ervice is important so that during development, different developers can use a syncronised database </li>
